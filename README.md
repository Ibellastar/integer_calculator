# Exercise: Integer Calculator

## Introduction

In this exercise you will practice working with arithmetic operators and variables with the C programming language.

### Starter Files

The starter files for this exercise are located in the `src` directory. Implement the empty functions in ths following files:

1. `calculator.c`
2. `calculator.h`
3. `main.c`

### Run Checks

To check your work, run the following command:

```bash
$ make all -C .github/checker
```

This will run the tests and output the results.

### Output

If all checks pass, you will see the following output:

```bash
Ok:                 6
Expected Fail:      0
Fail:               0
Unexpected Pass:    0
Skipped:            0
Timeout:            0
```

If there are failing checks you will see summary of the failing tests:

```
