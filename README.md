# Exercise: Integer Calculator

## Introduction

In this exercise you will practice working with arithmetic operators and variables with the C programming language.

// include function names 
// include an example of command line interface

### Starter Files

The starter files for this exercise are located in the `src` directory. Implement the empty functions in ths following files:

1. `calculator.c`
2. `calculator.h`
3. `main.c`

### Run Checks

To check your work, run the following command:

```bash
$ make all -C .github/checker
```

This will run the tests and output the results.

### Output

If all checks pass, you will see the following output:

```bash
Ok:                 6

Fail:               0
Unexpected Pass:    0
Skipped:            0
Timeout:            0
```

If there are failing checks you will see summary of the failing tests:

```
Summary of Failures:

1/4 Addition          FAIL            0.14s   exit status 2
